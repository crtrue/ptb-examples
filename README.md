# ptb-examples
Examples and snippets for those getting their feet wet with both Python and using python-telegram-bot

The goal of this project is to provide "batteries included" example scripts for common and uncommon use cases rather than simple snippets that beginner programmers may struggle with integrating into existing code. By providing the how, the why, the where, and the when, the hope is that one can learn to use the library and Python in general more succesfully in creating their own code.
